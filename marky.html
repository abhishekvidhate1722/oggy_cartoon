   <i> <p>Marky is one of the main villains in the series, along with Joey and Dee Dee. He is named after the drummer of the punk rock band, The Ramones, Marky Ramone.Marky is tactful and is often seen as lazy, often not caring what the other two cockroaches are doing. Although he initially enjoys causing mischief just like the other cockroaches, he becomes more relaxed in later episodes, though he still enjoys hanging out with Joey and Dee Dee and continues to cause general mayhem as he often does</p></i>
