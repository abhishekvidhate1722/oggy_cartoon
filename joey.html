   <i> <p>Joey is a short, pink-bodied, purple-headed anthropomorphic cockroach. He wears white gloves and has a pink or red right eye (i.e., the artists incidentally switch them ), and a yellow left eye. While reflecting or generally when not in a good mood, he moves slowly and stiffly, and when operating in his plans, he can be fast-moving and stealthy.</p></i>
