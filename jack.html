   <i> <p>Jack is Oggy's cousin and sidekick, and the deuteragonist of the series. In the Hindi dub, Jack is depicted as the older brother of Oggy.Jack can be described as the opposite of Oggy. He is quick-tempered, violent, focused, self-important, sometimes lazy, and a mechanic. He is focused on getting rid of the Cockroaches or doing something selfish. Jack often builds something to try and destroy the Cockroaches, or any other insect that roams Oggy's house, and while he has had some success, most of his plans backfire..</p></i>
